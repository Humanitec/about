# We are Humanitec
we build an elegant, open API and a developer-focussed UI to master Continuous Delivery for Kubernetes-native applications. It helps teams increase development velocity by allowing engineers to easily spin up the tech they need on their own. Using Humanitec's abstractions and integrations, teams manage environments, simplify maintenance and prevent cloud vendor lock-in.
